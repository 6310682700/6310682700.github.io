Oh I still have a lot of space to write? And you want to know more about me? Oh I am faltered. if you insist to know me then I will tell you that I recommend you to go play [**_OMORI_**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150690/OMORI/) Its a Psychological Horror game that will make you invest in a rich lore and amazing character developement. if you still not convice I pick some of the review that reconmend this game on steam page for you.  
  
> this game made me mentally ill  
> **_-pluto_  168.9 hrs on record**
  
> This game makes you really feel like you have depression.  
> **_-A Dummy_ 33.3 hrs on record**
  
> NOTE: Don't play this game during depression or when you're in a weak mental headspace or this game can overwhelm you beyond your soul. Play it when you're happy or in a good headspace.

>Anyway this game has ruined my life and I had to stop playing it for a while but I have to say this is the best game I've played in my entire life. What the protagonist goes through is similar to what I'm going through and I felt like I was there. The game deals with realistic problems in a very realistic way - and with very original and unique interpretations of the problems.

Also **I don't recommend you look for any spoil for this game** trust me either you want to play this game or not the spoil will ruin all the fun for you. If you still don't convince I would still reconmend you to atleast go watch a playthough online.
  
With that out of the way. I hope that this will help anyone to know be better in some way. Thank you for reading.
