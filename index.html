            NOTE: Don't play this game during depression or when you're in a weak mental headspace or this game can overwhelm you beyond your soul. Play it when you're happy or in a good headspace.
            <br>
            <br> Anyway this game has ruined my life and I had to stop playing it for a while but I have to say this is the best game I've played in my entire life. What the protagonist goes through is similar to what I'm going through and I felt like I was there. The game deals with realistic problems in a very realistic way - and with very original and unique interpretations of the problems.

    <p>Also <span class="bold red">I don't recommend you look for any spoil for this game</span> trust me either you want to play this game or not. the spoil will ruin all the fun for you. If you still don't convince I would still reconmend you to atleast go watch a playthough online.</p>
  
    <p> With that out of the way. I hope that this will help anyone to know be better in some way. Thank you for reading.</p>
